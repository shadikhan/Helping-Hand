Helping Hand is an app that allows users to find community service opportunities anywhere. Users will have the ability to register for volunteering opportunities as well has the chance to post their own volunteering events if they themselves are looking for volunteers. We also allow for filtering of events to expose users to volunteering opportunities that accomodate their preferred date, time, and/or locale.
